# 🐍 Snake Game – Machine Learning with Weka

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project was developed as part of my coursework during the second year of my **Data Science & Engineering** degree. It represents an early exploration of applying machine learning concepts in practice.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project applies **Machine Learning methodologies** to the classic **Snake game**, using the Weka platform for data analysis and modeling. The core objectives include:

- Developing predictive and classification models based on gameplay data.
- Constructing an **autonomous agent** that can control the snake intelligently using the trained models.

Through this project, we explore how traditional ML techniques can be adapted to real-time decision-making in games.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 🧪 **Weka** – for data preprocessing, training classifiers, and evaluation
- 💻 **Python and Java** – for Snake game implementation and integration with Weka models
- 📈 **ML Algorithms** – Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, k-NN, etc.

## 🤖 Intelligent Agent

An **autonomous snake** was implemented to:
- Collect features at each time step (e.g., direction to food, danger in next move, current length)
- Use a trained model to choose the next direction
- Play the game based on model predictions

This allowed us to test and compare different machine learning strategies in a dynamic environment.
